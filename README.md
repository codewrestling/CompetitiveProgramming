##### Question 1
###### TWO NUMBER SUM (Refer blog [Two Number Sum](https://codewrestling.medium.com/two-number-sum-competitive-programming-question-with-time-and-space-complexity-24d60b0015f8))

---

Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum. If any two numbers in the input array sum up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array, in any order. If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array.

Note that the target sum has to be obtained by summing two different integers in the array; you can't add a single integer to itself in order to obtain the target sum.

###### Sample Test
array = [3, 5, -4, 8, 11, 1, -1, 6]
targetSum = 10

###### Sample Output
[-1,11]

##### Question 2
###### Validate Subsequence (Refer Blog [Validate Subsequence](https://codewrestling.medium.com/validate-subsequence-with-time-and-space-complexity-competitive-programming-6571f3575cc2)

---

Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one. A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that arenâ€™t necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array.

For instance, the numbers [1, 3, 4] form a subsequence of the array [1, 2, 3, 4], and so do the numbers [2, 4]. Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid subsequences of the array.

###### Sample Test
array = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
sequence = [1, 6, -1, 10]

###### Sample Output
true
